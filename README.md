- Cross browser compatibility
- fully accessible through a keyboard
- deployed on HEROKU

## The Making
The structure is semantic, made with HTML5, accessible to screen readers.
Template tags are used to serve several components.

Designed with CSS3, SASS is used for preprocessing and Autoprefixer for browser vendors.

Javascript makes this interactive with several buttons and a search bar.

This is a node express app.

This website uses [JSONPLACEHOLDER](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/) open source api for dummy articles and [RANDOMUSER](https://randomuser.me/) for dummy identities.

It has a search functionality, both on the home page and on the article page, to search for different articles or content respectively.

Uses can like and share the article, even comment on it.
Again [JSONPLACEHOLDER](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/) is used for dummy comments.
